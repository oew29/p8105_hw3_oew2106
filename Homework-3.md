## Problem 1

**Description:** The data set is a sample of orders from the online
grocery store Instacart. The data is organized first by the order ID and
then by the individual products in the order which are further
categorized by product type and name. For each order ID there is a
single user ID which correlates to the purchaser, as well as the last
time the user purchased products from Instacart. The variable eval\_set
also indicates that this data set is derived from a much larger data
set, and was used for predicitive analyitics likely pertaining to the
purchase frequency, amount and product type. In all, there are 1,384,617
rows and 15 columns of data.

  - There are 134 aisles, and the most items are ordered from the 83rd
    aisle (150609). This is narrowly larger than the 24th aisle
    (150473). After these two aisles, there is a dramatic drop in the
    number of items ordered.
